 SmartShell AI 🚀

SmartShell AI is an AI-powered Linux Shell Assistant that translates natural language inputs into powerful Bash commands. It leverages AI agents to process, execute, and handle Linux commands efficiently, providing a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

---

## 🌟 **Features**

- **Natural Language Processing:** Converts natural language inputs to Bash commands.  
- **Command Execution:** Executes Linux commands in a safe and controlled environment.  
- **Error Handling:** Provides error handling and feedback for invalid commands.  
- **Dark Mode Toggle:** Switch between light and dark themes.  
- **Interactive AI Robot:** Animated AI robot for visual interaction.  
- **Streamlit Interface:** Modern, responsive, and user-friendly UI.

## 🔥 **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** Streamlit, Python  
- **Backend:** Flask, Python  
- **AI Models:** NLP Processing with custom AI agents  
- **Environment:** WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

## 🛠️ **Installation and Setup**

### **1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smartshell-ai.git
cd smartshell-ai
````

---

### **2. Set up the virtual environment:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.10-venv -y
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

---

### **3. Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **4. Set up WSL for command execution:**

* Ensure WSL is properly configured.
* Update WSL by running:

```bash
wsl --update
```

* Verify WSL version:

```bash
wsl -l -v
```

---

### **5. Start the Streamlit application:**

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## 📦 **Dependencies:**

* Python 3.10
* Streamlit
* Flask
* OpenAI (for NLP processing)
* subprocess (for command execution)

---

## 🚀 **How It Works:**

1. **User Input:** Enter a Linux command in natural language.
2. **NLP Processing:** The AI agent processes the command and generates the corresponding Bash command.
3. **Command Execution:** The Bash command is executed in the WSL environment.
4. **Result Display:** The output of the command execution is displayed in the Streamlit app.

---

## 🛡️ **Error Handling:**

* Invalid commands are identified and the user receives feedback.
* Errors during execution are displayed with specific error messages.

---

## 🧪 **Testing:**

* Test command execution using sample commands like:

  * `Create a new directory named testdir`
  * `List all files in the current directory`
